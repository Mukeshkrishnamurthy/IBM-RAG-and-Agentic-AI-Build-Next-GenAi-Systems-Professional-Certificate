    "Estimated time needed: **30** minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you'll master two fundamental agentic design patterns that power modern AI workflows. You'll build a parallel meal planning system that coordinates multiple AI chefs, and an iterative investment advisor that refines recommendations through continuous feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world impact**: These patterns are used in production systems at leading companies such as Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM, and Google—enabling AI agents to collaborate, self-improve, and tackle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks across domains from research to customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI systems take on more complex problems, a critical challenge arises:  \n",
    "**How can we coordinate multiple agents or components to work collaboratively, intelligently, and adaptively?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **LangGraph** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** is a framework for building **stateful, dynamic, and modular AI workflows**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional linear chains, LangGraph enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔄 **Iterative refinement**: Incorporate feedback loops and self-correction logic  \n",
    "- 🧵 **Conditional routing**: Dynamically choose different paths based on intermediate results  \n",
    "- ⚡️ **Parallel execution**: Process independent subtasks concurrently to boost efficiency  \n",
    "- 🧠 **Global state management**: Maintain and evolve shared context across complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "With LangGraph, your workflows become more than just pipelines; they become **intelligent systems** capable of reasoning, adapting, and improving over time. This is **ideal** for use cases such as multi-agent collaboration, decision-making, evaluation loops, and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be loosely following [this](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/#orchestrator-worker) LangGraph tutorial throughout this lab.\n",

    "# Orchestrator-Worker Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator-worker pattern is a powerful approach for handling complex, unpredictable tasks by dynamically **breaking them into manageable pieces** and **processing them in parallel**. When you can't predict upfront how many subtasks you'll need or what they'll involve, this pattern shines by intelligently **analyzing** the input, **decomposing** it into structured work units, and **assigning** specialized workers to handle each piece independently. This pattern is widely used in real-world AI workflow systems, including industry solutions such as IBM’s [Watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-Agentic+Design+Patterns+in+LangGraph-v1_1752612018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a busy catering kitchen that takes orders for large events—when a customer orders \"I want a three-course meal, hamburgers for lunch, and pizza for dinner,\" the head chef (orchestrator) analyzes the request and breaks it down into specific dishes, then assigns specialized culinary consultants to create detailed meal plans for each cuisine. Each consultant specializes in a specific cuisine, for example, one expert in Italian cuisine handles the pizza planning, while an American cuisine specialist develops the hamburger menu. The key is that each consultant receives a **clear, structured brief** with dish requirements and dietary considerations, not just \"plan something good.\" In our meal planning system, user requests such as \"feed my family for the week\" could result in anywhere from 3 to 15 different dishes, each requiring a specialist consultant's expertise in their particular cuisine to create comprehensive meal plans.\n",

The `StateGraph` defines how those nodes are connected and how data (state) flows between them. In a `StateGraph`, the input state travels through the workflow getting updated at each state, this is why the naming convention of the state remains consistent throughout the workflow.\n",

    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the graph** with a `State` schema that defines what information will persist and evolve across the workflow.\n",

    "    - `orchestrator`, `chef_worker`, and `synthesizer`\n",
    "4. **Connect the nodes** using:\n",
    "   - `.add_edge(from_node, to_node)` for simple sequential steps\n",
    "   - `.add_conditional_edges(...)` for dynamic routing or parallel fan-out\n",
    "5. **Compile the graph** to finalize structure and validation.\n"

      "This investment strategy aims for a high target return of 15% and includes a significant allocation (60%) to equities, particularly high-growth sectors. While there are elements of risk management and some capital preservation through fixed income and inflation-protection assets, the overall reliance on growth equities, emerging markets, and alternative investments like cryptocurrency indicates a higher risk profile. The inclusion of hedge funds and private equity also adds speculative elements. This plan aligns with the investor's high-risk tolerance but carries substantial volatility and potential for significant loss, classifying it as aggressive.\n",

      "### Revised Investment Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investor Profile Summary:**\n",
      "- **Age:** 29\n",
      "- **Salary:** $110,000\n",
      "- **Assets:** $40,000\n",
      "- **Goal:** Financial independence by age 45\n",
      "- **Risk Tolerance:** High\n",
      "\n",
      "**Target Return:** 15%\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Investment Strategy Overview:**\n",
      "This strategy will maintain the ambitious target of 15% returns while integrating enhanced risk management and capital preservation principles. It will balance high-growth potential assets with more conservative selections to address the concerns regarding volatility and risk exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Asset Allocation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Equities (60% Total)**\n",
      "- **Growth Equities (30%):** \n",
      "  - Focus on sectors like technology and consumer discretionary, which historically outperform during economic expansion. Consider high-growth ETFs or sector-specific funds.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Defensive Equities (20%):**\n",
      "  - Invest in dividend-paying stocks and sectors like utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples to provide stability and income.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Emerging Markets (10%):**\n",
      "  - Target emerging markets ETFs to gain exposure to high-growth economies, maintaining a diversified approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Fixed Income (20% Total)**\n",
      "- **Government Bonds (10%):**\n",
      "  - Invest in a mix of long-term and short-term U.S. Treasuries to provide capital preservation and reduced volatility.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Corporate Bonds (10%):**\n",
      "  - Focus on high-quality corporate bonds to balance risk and yield, ensuring income while managing credit risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Inflation-Protection Assets (10% Total)**\n",
      "- **TIPS (5%):**\n",
      "  - Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities to hedge against inflation and preserve purchasing power.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Commodities/REITs (5%):**\n",
      "  - Invest in commodity-focused ETFs or REITs that can provide a hedge against inflation and contribute to diversification.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Alternative Investments (10% Total)**\n",
      "- **Hedge Funds or Private Equity Funds (5%):**\n",
      "  - Consider allocating to liquid alternative investments that can enhance returns during volatile markets.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Cryptocurrency/Blockchain (5%):**\n",
      "  - A small allocation to cryptocurrencies as a high-risk, high-reward component, understanding the volatility involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Risk Management:**\n",
      "- **Volatility Control:**\n",
      "  - Use risk parity weighting to adjust investments based on volatility rather than dollar amounts. Prioritize stable, low-volatility assets during uncertain economic conditions.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Regular Rebalancing:**\n",
      "  - Implement a quarterly review and rebalancing strategy to maintain target asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions and personal circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Emergency Fund:**\n",
      "  - Maintain a cash reserve equivalent to at least 6 months of living expenses, separate from this investment portfolio, to ensure financial security and flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Tactical Adjustments Based on Economic Conditions:**\n",
      "- **If Economic Growth Accelerates:**\n",
      "  - Increase allocation to growth equities and small-cap funds.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **If Inflation Rises:**\n",
      "  - Shift more towards TIPS, commodities, and REITs while reducing duration on bonds.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **If Stagflation Concerns Arise:**\n",
      "  - Emphasize energy, materials, and international exposure while maintaining inflation hedges.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **If Economic Uncertainty Persists:**\n",
      "  - Implement an \"All Weather\" strategy with a balanced mix of assets across the risk spectrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**\n",
      "- **Feedback Loop:**\n",
      "  - Conduct bi-annual evaluations of investment performance and risk metrics, adapting strategies based on outcomes and changing economic conditions.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Investor Education:**\n",
      "  - Stay informed about macroeconomic trends, market movements, and investment strategies. Consider attending workshops and reading financial literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Conclusion:**\n",
      "This revised investment strategy aims to achieve a 15% return through a more balanced approach that reduces volatility while still capturing growth opportunities. By integrating risk management practices and focusing on capital preservation, this plan aligns better with the investor's high-risk tolerance while addressing concerns about previous strategies.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we’ve explored how **LangGraph** empowers you to build dynamic, agentic AI workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout, we learned and applied important concepts such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Orchestrator–Worker Pattern**  \n",
    "   - High-level planning with an orchestrator node  \n",
    "   - Parallel task execution by independent worker nodes  \n",
    "   - Automatic state merging via `Annotated` fields\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reflection Pattern**  \n",
    "   - Iterative generate–evaluate loops inspired by real investor personas  \n",
    "   - Structured feedback using Pydantic output parsers  \n",
    "   - Conditional routing to refine or accept results until they meet targets\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Management & Routing**  \n",
    "   - A shared `State` schema carrying context across nodes  \n",
    "   - Flexible fan-out and conditional edges (`Send`, `add_conditional_edges`)  \n",
    "   - Loop control via iteration counters and routing logic\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization & Testing**  \n",
    "   - Mermaid diagrams for graph structure inspection  \n",
    "   - Manual simulations and pretty-print utilities for debugging and presentation\n",
    "\n",

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check out [Watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-Agentic+Design+Patterns+in+LangGraph-v1_1752612018)**: AI Agents for business to automate and handle simple tasks using orchestration.\n",
    "- **Extend the Patterns**: Try the optimizer (plan–evaluate) pattern or combine reflection with reinforcement learning.\n",
    "- **Domain Adaptation**: Swap out the grocery-list or investment example for customer support, legal drafting, or robotic control.\n",
    "- **Monitoring & Metrics**: Instrument your graph with logging, latency tracking, and success/failure metrics.\n",
    "- **Error Handling & Robustness**: Add retry policies, fallback nodes, and alerting for production readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these design patterns—**orchestration**, **evaluation**, **reflection**, and **routing**—you can create truly **agentic systems** that plan, critique, adapt, and improve over time. \n",
