    "You're a software engineer on a mission: build an AI agent that doesn't just respond—it thinks. In this lab, you'll step into the role of an AI architect, designing a smart assistant that solves tough problems by reasoning through them and taking purposeful actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework, you'll teach your agent to think step by step, consult tools like search engines or calculators, and adapt on the fly. It’s not just about answers—it’s about how the agent gets there.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the lab, your AI will face a mystery that can’t be solved with knowledge alone. It will need logic, resourcefulness, and the ability to act—just like you, the engineer who built it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is ReAct?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReAct** stands for **Reasoning + Acting**. It's a framework that combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reasoning**: The agent thinks through problems step by step, maintaining an internal dialogue about what it needs to do.\n",
    "2. **Acting**: The agent can use external tools (search engines, calculators, APIs) to gather information or perform actions.\n",
    "3. **Observing**: The agent processes the results from its actions and incorporates them into its reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a powerful loop: **Think → Act → Observe → Think → Act → ...**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why ReAct Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional language models are limited by their training data cutoff and can't access real-time information. ReAct agents overcome this by:\n",
    "- Accessing current information through web searches\n",
    "- Performing calculations with specialized tools\n",
    "- Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps\n",
    "- Adapting their approach based on intermediate results\n"
